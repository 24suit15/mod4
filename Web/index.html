  <main>
    <p class="pa">Whales are large, warm-blooded, air-breathing marine mammals with torpedo-shaped bodies, streamlined for swimming, and forelimbs modified into flippers for steering. They nurse their young with milk and have horizontal tail flukes for propulsion. </p>

    <p class="pa">Whales have a thick layer of blubber for insulation and breathe through a blowhole on top of their heads. They are divided into two main groups: toothed whales (like sperm whales) and baleen whales (like blue whales), which possess baleen plates to filter food from the water.  </p>
